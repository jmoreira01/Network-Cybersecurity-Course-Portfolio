Welcome to my GitHub portfolio for the Network & Cybersecurity Administration course! Here, I will list all my projects related to Networking and Cybersecurity, each with a brief description.

## Projects

### 1. Basic Network Configuration
- **Description**: This project demonstrates the configuration of a network using a Cisco router, including IP assignment, DHCP setup, and connectivity for multiple devices (PCs and switches). The network features three subnets: 10.255.255.0/24, 172.31.255.0/24, and 192.168.29.0/24, all connected to a central router.
